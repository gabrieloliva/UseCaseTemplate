# UseCase Template
Xcode templates Use Cases. This current version was strictly made to my personal usage. ðŸ˜… 

## What is it? ##
This repo stores XCode templates, that allows you to create UseCases in Swift.

## How to use? ##
If you are using Xcode just go to Application folder, browse to the Xcode application icon. Right-click it and choose 'Show Package Contents'. Then browse to: `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS` and add `UseCase Template.xctemplate` there. That's it. Now you can find your template in XCode -> New File -> iOS -> Source
